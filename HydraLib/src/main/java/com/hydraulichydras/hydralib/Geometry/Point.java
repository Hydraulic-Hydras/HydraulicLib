/**
 * A Point class is a fundamental component used to represent a point in a two-dimensional or three-dimensional space.
 * It typically contains attributes to store the coordinates of the point.
 * <p>
 * In 2D space, a point is defined by its x and y coordinates, while in 3D space, it would have x, y, and z coordinates.
 * <p>
 * I have it limited to x, y, as the z coordinate would be considered heading in the Pose class
